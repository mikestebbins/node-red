  "readme": "node-red-node-rbe\n=================\n\nA <a href=\"http://nodered.org\" target=\"_new\">Node-RED</a> node that provides\nprovides report-by-exception (RBE) and deadband capability.\n\nThe node blocks unless the incoming value changes - RBE mode, or\nchanges by more than a certain amount (absolute value or percentage) - deadband\nmode.\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nRun the following command in your Node-RED install directory, usually\n`~/.node-red`\n\n    npm install node-red-node-rbe\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nA simple node to provide report by exception (RBE) and deadband function\n- only passes on data if it has changed.\n\nThis works on a per **msg.topic** basis. This means that a single rbe node can\nhandle multiple topics at the same time.\n\n###RBE mode\n\nThe node doesn't send any output until the **msg.payload** is different to the previous one.\nWorks on numbers and strings. Useful for filtering out repeated messages of the\nsame value. Saves bandwidth, etc...\n\n###Deadband mode\n\nIn deadband mode the incoming payload should contain a parseable *number* and is\noutput only if greater than + or - the *band gap* away from the previous output.\n\nThe deadband value can be specified as a fixed number, or a percentage. E.g. 10\nor 5% . If % mode is used then the output will only get sent if the input payload\nvalue is equal or more than the specified % away from the previously sent value.\n\nFor example - if last sent value was 100, and deadband is set to 10% - a value\nof 110 will pass - then the next value has to be 121 in order to pass (= 110 + 10% = 121).\n\nThis is mainly useful if you want to operate across multiple topics at the same\ntime that may have widely differing input ranges.\n\nWill only accept numbers, or parseable strings like  \"18.4 C\"  or \"$500\"\n",
