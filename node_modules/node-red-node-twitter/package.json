  "readme": "node-red-node-twitter\n=====================\n\n<a href=\"http://nodered.org\" target=\"_new\">Node-RED</a> nodes to talk to Twitter.\n\nThe Twitter API will **NOT** deliver 100% of all tweets. This does **NOT** give access to the Twitter Firehose.\n\nTweets of who you follow will include their retweets and favourites.\n\n**Note** : This is the same node as was in the core of Node-RED.\nAs of v0.10.8 it will be installed from here instead.\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nRun the following command in the root directory of your Node-RED install, usually\nthis is ~/.node-red .\n\n        npm install node-red-node-twitter\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nProvides two nodes - one to receive messages, and one to send.\n\n###Input\n\nTwitter input node. Can be used to search either:\n\n - the public or a user's stream for tweets containing the configured search term\n - all tweets by specific users\n - direct messages received by the authenticated user\n\nUse **space** for *and*, and **comma** , for *or* when searching for multiple terms.\n\nSets the **msg.topic** to *tweets/* and then appends the senders screen name.\n\nSets **msg.location** to the tweeters location if known.\n\nSets **msg.tweet** to the full tweet object as documented by <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/docs/platform-objects/tweets\">Twitter</a>.\n\n**Note:** when set to a specific user's tweets, or your direct messages, the node is subject to\nTwitter's API rate limiting. If you deploy the flows multiple times within a 15 minute window, you may\nexceed the limit and will see errors from the node. These errors will clear when the current 15 minute window\npasses.\n\n\n###Output\n\nTweets the **msg.payload**.\n\nTo send a Direct Message (DM) - use a payload like.\n\n        D {username} {message}\n\nIf **msg.media** exists and is a Buffer object, this node will treat it as an image and attach it to the tweet.\n",
